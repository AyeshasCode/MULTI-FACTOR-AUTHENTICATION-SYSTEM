# MULTI-FACTOR-AUTHENTICATION-SYSTEM
<br>
 The Multi Factor Authentication System provides secure and reliable user authentication
by combining face recognition, voice analysis, and real-time liveness detection.
<br>
 It uses AI-powered biometric verification to prevent spoofing attempts and ensure only
authorized users gain access.
<br>
 The system generates random text prompts during authentication, ensuring that the
user is actively present and responding in real time.
<br>
 It includes lip-sync verification as an extra security layer to further enhance protection.
<br>
 This advanced authentication system ensures high security, usability, and adaptability,
making it a powerful solution for secure access control.

# TECHNICAL APPROACH
<br>
# Programming Languages : Python
<br>
# Frameworks and Libraries : OpenCV , face-recognition , Whisper ,fuzzywuzzy ,noise
reduce ,MediaPipe , sounddevice and soundfile
<br>
# PyQt : For creating & designing a graphical user interface (UI) of the application.
Storage : Face encodings and voice samples are stored in local folders, planning to
migrate to cloud-based storage for scalability and security.
<br>
# This System leverages AI for automation, ML for feature extraction and similarity
matching, and DL for advanced face, voice, and lip-sync verification, ensuring secure
and accurate user authentication.
