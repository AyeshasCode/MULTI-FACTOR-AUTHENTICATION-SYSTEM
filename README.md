# Multi-Factor Authentication System

A robust **AI-powered Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** system that combines **Face Recognition**, **Voice Analysis**, **Liveness Detection**, and **Lip Sync Verification** to provide high-security, real-time, and user-friendly authentication.

---

## Features

- **Face Recognition** using deep learning and real-time webcam input
- **Voice Matching** and speech-to-text conversion
- **Liveness Detection** with randomized text prompts and response validation
- **Lip Sync Verification** to ensure the speaker matches the lip movement
- **AI-powered biometric security** with anti-spoofing
- **Local data storage** (Cloud integration planned)

## Authentication Flow

```text
[1] User opens the app 
      ↓  
[2] Face Recognition → Verified?  
      ↓  
[3] Random Text Prompt Generated  
      ↓  
[4] User Speaks Prompt → Voice Verified?  
      ↓  
[5] Lip Movements Verified (Lip Sync Match)?  
      ↓  
[6] Authentication Success / Denied
